        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Macaroni and cheese is a dish of cooked macaroni pasta and a cheese sauce, most commonly cheddar. It can also incorporate other ingredients, such as breadcrumbs or meat.
        </p>
        <p>
            Traditional macaroni and cheese is a casserole baked in the oven; however, it may be prepared in a sauce pan on top of the stove or using a packaged mix. The cheese is often first incorporated into a Béchamel sauce to create a Mornay sauce, which is then added to the pasta.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) box of elbow macaroni</li>
            <li>¼ cup of butter</li>
            <li>¼ cup of all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon of salt</li>
            <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 cups of milk</li>
            <li>2 cups of shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                At the same time, melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add flour, salt, and pepper and stir until smooth, about 5 minutes. Pour in milk slowly, while stirring continuously. Continue to cook and stir until mixture is smooth and bubbling, about 5 minutes, making sure the milk doesn't burn.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add Cheddar cheese and stir until melted, 2 to 4 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Drain macaroni and fold into cheese sauce until coated.
            </li>
