        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Frappuccino is a type of blended coffee drink that is trademarked by Starbucks. Made with ice, coffee, and flavored syrups, the beverage's flavor and texture is somewhere between a milkshake and an iced coffee.

            The word "Frappuccino" is a combination of "lait frappe" (a type of French milkshake) and "cappuccino" (an espresso-based coffee drink with steamed milk).
