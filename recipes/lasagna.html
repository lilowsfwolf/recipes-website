        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Lasagne; singular lasagna, are a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made of very wide, flat sheets.
            Either term can also refer to an Italian dish made of stacked layers of lasagne alternating with fillings such as
            ragù (ground meats and tomato sauce), vegetables, cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella, and parmesan),
            and seasonings and spices, like Italian seasoning, such as garlic, oregano and basil. The dish may be topped
                with grated cheese, which becomes melted after baking. Typically cooked pasta is assembled with the other
                ingredients and then baked in an oven. The resulting baked pasta is cut into single-serving square portions.

            <li>1 tablespoon of dried onion flakes</li>
            <li>2 (14 ounce) jars of marinara sauce</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package of lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>8 ounces of ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1 pound of mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Brown the ground beef and Italian sausage in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Drain excess grease. Stir in the water and black olives, and season with basil, garlic powder, oregano, sage, pepper, minced garlic, and onion flakes. Simmer for about 15 minutes, stirring frequently. Stir in the marinara sauce, and remove from the heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>
                Place a layer of the meat and sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Cover with a layer of dry noodles. Spread a thin layer of ricotta cheese over the noodles, and sprinkle with a little mozzarella cheese. Cover with another layer of sauce, and repeat layering ending with the meat and sauce on top. Reserve about 1/2 cup of mozzarella cheese for later.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake for 45 minutes in the preheated oven, but check after 30 minutes depending on how thick the lasagna is. Lasagna is cooked when you can easily stick a knife into it. Sprinkle the reserved cheese over the top, and return to the oven for about 10 minutes for a nice melted cheese topping.
